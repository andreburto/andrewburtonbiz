# CloudFront Test

## About

Testing out using [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) to host a static page and using [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/) with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) for dynamic content.
Once I got over my faux outrage that API Gateway charged for custom domains, it really started to appeal.
This project is not good for anything, but some of the ideas may bleed into my [Turboman project](https://github.com/andreburto/turboman/).

## To Do

- Create a proper deployment system that runs the API Gateway deploy after Terraform finishes.
- Figure out how to automate image generation without giving my ID to Sam Altman.
